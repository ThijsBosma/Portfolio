                        <p class="large">My name is Thijs Bosma, I am 18 years old, I am from The Netherlands and I am a second year student at Grafisch Lyceum Utrecht. I enjoy making systems in games that challenge me to learn new things that I could also apply in different projects.</p>
                            <p class="large">When I have free time I enjoy playing games, cooking food, spending time with other people or being out in nature. When playing games I prefer to play FPS games but usually don't stick to one genre completely. My favorite thing to make in the kitchen is pasta with various sauces but I always enjoy making new things.</p>
                            <p class="large">When hanging out with friends I don't usually mind what we do as long as I can spend time with them! My favortie thing in nature is easily the mountains, each year when I go on vacation in the summer I go with my parents and we always go to the mountains. I love walking in the mountains because I get amazing views and moments I never forget!</p>

                                         <p>In this project we got tasked with making any type of game we wanted that had to be compatible with WebGL and posted to itch.io after 8 weeks. For this project I got chosen for a exchange project which still had the same task but I would be working with students from Finland.</p>   
                                            <p>When we heard we were able to make whatever we wanted we brainstormed for quite a while and decided to go with a puzzle game. We really wanted to build a puzzle game because of the infinite amount of possibilities and challenges it could come with. Our game was based a lot on captain toad treasure tracker and we decided to use the same type of camera movement you see in that game.</p>

                                            <p>Seeing as I got chosen for the exchange project this came with multiple extra difficulties the biggest one being that for 6 weeks we had to work abroad and not be able to communicate with everyone face to face. On discord we often let everyone know what we were doing and if certain things were doable or not. This taught me alot for communicating with people when im not right next to them and be able to help other people even though they are in a entire different country then I am.</p>

                                            <p>We wanted a quick way to get around the stage and add verticality without using stairs</p>
                                            <p>In our game we decided to add moving platforms that can take certain pickubable objects like a watering can and get them from point A to B, this also included the player. To activate these moving platforms there were multiple things located throughout the level like levers and buttons that when used would activate certain platforms.</p>
                                                <p>When the platform would reach its end we also had to make sure it would be able to loop back so that the player would not get stuck on a certain point of the level.</p>

                                        <h3 class="project-heading-myadditions">Summary</h3>
                                            <p>I worked on making the levels playable.</p>
                                            <p>For our game I made multiple blockouts for the levels to give the artists ideas of how the level would work and the general idea for the shapes of the levels. When I had some time I would also design certain puzzles and levels to lighten the workload of other people. Putting together the levels that were fully made by the artists also came with certain difficulties, this could be something as simple as a collider not being in the right place to something that would force me to change the way certain systems worked.</p>
                                                <p>When the levels were finished we had people test them out and let us know what could be different and as soon as we had this feedback I would change the parts of the level that were not fun to something that was better</p>
                                        <h3 class="project-heading-myadditions">Player</h3>
                                        <h3 class="project-heading-myadditions">Summary</h3>
                                        <p>I worked on a few things for the player such as climbing, model swap and animations</p>
                                            <p>I worked on a few things for the player aswell, I gave him functionality such as being able to climb, model swap, animations and give it an entire different script where we could save all the data so we would have been able to save it as a JSON file.</p>
                                                <p>We wanted to implement the climbing to be able to give elevation to the levels without having to use moving platforms everywhere, we showed climbable spots by placing down vines where the player can climb up. In level 2 we forced the player to climb up a vine and this way they learned that vines are climbable and help you reach certain spots.</p>
                                                    <p>When we got the player model there were quite a few things I had to change, this included: Changing certain colliders so they matched up with the new model, pickup and hold positions for when your picking items up and most importantly add the animations so it looked alot less stale. For the animations I used the animator in unity with certain parameters. I had a playerAnimator script in which I changed the animator parameter based on if certain actions were happening for example the player moving.</p>
                                                        <p>We wanted to be able to save the progress of the player so they did not have to constantly restart from scratch. We wanted to save the PlayerData to a JSON file and then load that file again when the player launched the game on itch so they still had their progress. Sadly because of the time we were unable to make this work on itch but we did have a working variant for if we ever released it on desktop</p>

                                        <p>In this project we were tasked to make a racing game with a night theme. The goal in this game is to race around the track and get the best time possible. The way we motivate you to do this is by having multiple characters that you need a specific time to unlock. <p>

                                            <p>The game itself was quite simple but we still needed to give the feeling of speed to the player without having the car go extremely fast. The way we did this was by adding camera shake and a dynamic camera that goes further back when you speed up and goes more to the front when you are braking.<p>

                                        <p>The reason we wanted a roguelike was because it would come with multiple challenges and we all could learn a lot from this genre</p>
                                            <p>The goal of the game is to survive the chambers and kill all the skeletons in order to proceed onwards and beat the level</p>

                                            <p>I had the task of making the enemies work in the game. For this I decided to use a brain script that was given to us at the start of the project and added my own things when necessary. The enemies did not have too many behaviours they had to be able to wander and chase the player to attack</p>
                                                <p>I wanted to make the system really easy to work with for other people so I decided that I would make a base enemy script in order to use inheritance.</p>

                                            <p>Because we wanted variety with the enemies the player was facing I also made some extra but simple variants of enemies using the base script. These included a fast enemy that moves quickly but has less health and a tank enemy that had more health but moved a bit slower.</p>

This way you can easily add new weapons and weapon types to the game because you only had to make the animation for it. To perform certain actions of the weapon we used animation events to put an hit box on for example.</P>
                                                <P>For the skeleton I put the model in mixamo and used those animations to make the skeleton walk around and shoot his bow. I also used animation events to make the skeleton perform certain actions at specific keyframes.</P>

                                        <p>The goal of the game is to walk around the facility and try and find the necessary keycard to continue in the level. You have to fight your way through droids that have been taken over by a virus. Its your task to get to the end and reset all the robots<p>

                                            <p>Because you had to go through the facility as fast as possible we still wanted to give the player some difficulty so he could not get to the end immediately. The way we did this was by adding keycards, we would place these all across the map and you would have to find the correct one to get to the next level.<p>

                                            <p>For our health system we decided to make a base script in order to use inheritance. This way other people were able to use the health function easily for a new enemy type</p>

                                            <p>We needed to give the player a way to dash and weave away from enemys when being shot at. Thats the reason why we decided to implement a dash, the dash has a cooldown and will shoot you in any direction you are currently walking.</p>

                                            <p>We wanted to make it so the player would have to kill all the enemys in a certain room in order to progress, the way we decided to implement this is by making a system where if all enemys are dead the final one will drop a keycard that is required to get to the next level</p>
